# Realtime Text Editor Project
This project is a collaborative Text Editor built using [React](https://react.dev/learn), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/), and [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com/docs/quickstart). It enables real-time editing and communication among users.
